# âš¡ Energy Usage Analysis â€“ Railway PSI System

**Author:** Nachiketa Pradhan  
**Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To analyze and visualize daily and monthly energy usage trends in traction substations (TSS/SP/SSP) to identify overloads and optimize power consumption.

## ðŸ“Š Process
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Visualization (trend, PF, monthly average)  
3. Detection of abnormal high-load days  
4. Dashboard creation in Power BI  

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Found 12% increase in energy use during summer  
- Identified 5 overload events with PF < 0.9  
- Automated report generation with Python  

## ðŸ’¡ Skills Demonstrated
- Data analytics using Python  
- Visualization & dashboard building  
- Power system domain understanding  
- Insight communication
